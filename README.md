## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I'm a career-switching Software Engineer with a background in leadership and operations, currently building strong foundations in full-stack development.

- 🎓 Software Engineering Microdegree (Code First Girls)
- 💻 Associate Software Engineer experience
- 🚀 Currently deepening my skills in JavaScript, React, Python & backend systems
- 🧠 Focused on writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code
- 🎭 Fun fact: I'm also a trained actress — storytelling and communication are my superpowers

I’m especially interested in:
- Frontend engineering
- Backend architecture
- System design fundamentals
- Performance optimisation
- Debugging and understanding code deeply (not just generating it)
